# Guess The Number - JavaScript ðŸ”¢

This is a simple game whose objective is to guess the correct number. 
The game was built with vanilla javascript and is one of the first projects I did during my education. 
The goal of this assignment was to familiarize yourself with and understand the logic behind if/else statements.
